# Button Clickability Issue - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified:
1. **Backend Connection**: The frontend proxy was trying to connect to `::1:5000` (IPv6) instead of `127.0.0.1:5000` (IPv4)
2. **CSS Z-Index**: Some elements might have been blocking button interactions
3. **Event Handlers**: Need to ensure onClick handlers are properly bound

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Frontend Proxy Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.js` to use `127.0.0.1:5000` instead of `localhost:5000`
- Added proxy debugging to help identify connection issues

### 2. Button Component Fixes
- Added explicit `z-index: 999` and `position: relative` to all buttons
- Added `cursor: pointer` class to make buttons clearly clickable
- Added console.log statements to debug click events
- Added alert() calls to immediately verify button clicks

### 3. CSS Updates
- Added global CSS rules to ensure buttons are always clickable:
  ```css
  button {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 10;
    pointer-events: auto !important;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  ```

### 4. Test Components Added
- **ButtonTest**: Simple test buttons with high z-index
- **SimpleMediaUpload**: Simplified upload component with inline styles

### 5. URL Fallback Strategy
- Updated all fetch calls to try both proxy URL and direct backend URL
- Example: tries `/api/media/upload-audio` first, then `http://localhost:5000/api/media/upload-audio`

## Testing Steps:

1. **Open Browser**: Go to http://localhost:3002
2. **Test Buttons**: Look for the test buttons in the top-right corner
3. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to see click logs
4. **Media Upload**: Try the MediaUpload component buttons
5. **Rant Submission**: Try submitting a rant

## Expected Results:
- Buttons should be clickable and show alerts
- Console should log button clicks
- API calls should succeed (or show specific error messages)
- Both proxy and direct backend URLs should work

## Backend Status:
- ✅ Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
- ✅ All endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ AI features working with Gemini

## Frontend Status:
- ✅ Running on http://localhost:3002
